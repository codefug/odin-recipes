    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This stuffed pork cutlet recipe has an unusual look and feel. I thought I'd seen all there was to see when it
        came to pan-fried pork cutlets, but then I saw something called "Katsu Mille-Feuille," and I realized I hadn't
        seen anything yet. Okay, I'm being a little dramatic, but I really loved the internal flavoring opportunities
        the multi-layer technique provides. I look forward to seeing what you come up with! Served here with a salad and
        a squeeze of lemon on top.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (1 pound) pork tenderloin, trimmed</li>
        <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 ounces Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3>step 1</h3>
        <li>Cut pork tenderloin in half lengthwise. Place each half between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound to
            1/8-inch thickness.
        </li>
        <h3>step 2</h3>
        <li>Remove top layer of plastic wrap. Season pork with salt, pepper, and cayenne; spread a thin layer of Dijon
            mustard on top. Grate Monterey Jack cheese over mustard and sprinkle with parsley.
        </li>
        <h3>step 3</h3>
        <li>Fold in the pointiest end 1/3 of the way. Fold in the sides. Give pork another fold; fold remaining end on
            top. Flip cutlets seam-side down in the plastic wrap and lightly pound until flattened. Unwrap cutlets and
            season again with salt, pepper, and cayenne.
        </li>
        <h3>step 4</h3>
        <li>Place cutlets onto a plate and dust on all sides with flour until lightly coated. Place beaten egg into a
            shallow dish; place bread crumbs into a second shallow dish. Dredge each cutlet in egg, then press in bread
            crumbs to coat. Let cutlets rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <h3>step 5</h3>
        <li>Heat at least 1/4 inch olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Cook each cutlet in hot oil until crust is
            browned and meat springs back when poked, 4 to 5 minutes per side.
        </li>
    </ol>
